# course-project-group-99

## a. Summary of Presentation Introduction

	We wanted to create a comprehensive rating platform tailored toward the courses and professors at UIUC. We consolidated ratings from "Rate My Professors" and Reddit, as well as course GPAs, in order to provide students with a broad overview of their course workload and difficulty. This involved the generation of course-specific metrics that incorporated NLP sentiment analysis and class section GPA to provide students with a recommendation about their inputted course.

## b. Describes Technical Architecture

## c. Provides Reproducible Installation Instruction
### We require you to have the following libraries installed: 
	json, rmp, flask, transformers, requests, re, base64, bs4
###  Our flask app is labelled "app.py" so you must cd to the folder "flask_tutorial" to run the app.Note that to run flask you may need to use one of the following commands:
	flask --app app run
  	
	python -m flask --app app run
 	
	python3 -m flask --app app run
	By default the flask server will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and this will be hyperlinked in the terminal
